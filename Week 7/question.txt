Q: Are there places in the World where there have not yet been more than 10 total infections(as of 31 March)? If so ,where are they?
(start from line 63)
Before analyzing the data, I assumed there was more than one country around the world remained low cases by 31 March. The country might mostly be isolated or hold a low population.
Because of the index error, I cannot find out whether the hypothesis is true or not.
